INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================
Duke basketball is great. Who doesn’t love Duke basketball? I’ll wait hours in
line to get into games. I’ll even sleep out in a tent for months to go to the
Duke vs. UNC game. I don’t mind waiting all that much, I think it’s worth it. I
do mind coordinating with all of my friends. Scheduling tenting shifts is a
pain. It’s hard to keep track of everything to make sure we are being as fair
as possible. Sometimes you’re in and out of the tent every 30-minutes when you
wish you could have been there for two hours straight and then have someone
else take your place. Other times you’d rather spend some extra hours in the
tent during the day to avoid a cold night.

With my independent study. I’m looking to automate the scheduling process. By
creating a Google Sheets add-on, tenters will be able to upload their
availability and use my custom algorithm to schedule their shifts. This document
walks through some of the thought behind the code in the add-on.


===============================================================================
CODE
===============================================================================
All code execution begins here. (Kept default name given by Google Apps Script).

onOpen()
Creates menu with ‘Schedule Shifts’ item on Google Sheets Toolbar to run
scheduling algorithm.

driver()
Function called when ‘Schedule Shifts’  is clicked. Gathers necessary data from
the spreadsheet during page initialization. Sets up and formats this data for
the scheduling algorithm. Runs the scheduling algorithm and updates all results
to the spreadsheet.


===============================================================================
WEIGHT
===============================================================================
Calculating weights is the core principle behind the scheduling algorithm. The
weight.gs file contains all of the weighting functions.

weightReset(slots)
Resets all weights to zero. (Every time a shift is scheduled, calculations are
going to change).

weightContiguous(people.slots,data,graveyard)
Prioritizes slots that create longer contiguous shifts or have the hope of
being part of a larger contiguous shift. Function looks at the time above and
the time below and runs through every possible case. The given case impacts the
resulting weight.

weightToughTime(people,slots,length)
Times that have fewer people available as a ratio of the number of people needed
are given a higher weight. (These slots will end up going to these people with a
higher likelihood anyways so it might as well happen earlier on.)

weightPreferenceMaxIdealDayHours(people,slots,data)
Counts the number of contiguous shifts directly above and directly below a given
slot. Based off of the resulting number and an individuals preferences, a weight
is applied to the slot. (If scheduling the shift would make the contiguous block
too long, the slot in question is given a low weight.)

weightPreferenceBestDay(people,slots)
Gives a tenter’s favorite day a slight bump over all other days.

weightPick(people, slots, results, graveyard, sheet,data)
Removes the slot with the highest weight. Updates all information associated with
that person. Checks to see if other time slots should also be removed and updates
them as well.


===============================================================================
SETUP
===============================================================================
Raw data from the spreadsheet is not organized well enough to execute a
scheduling algorithm. The setup.gs file takes this data and makes it readable
for the algorithm.

createPeople(data,preferencesData)
Iterates through each value in the Master Schedule spreadsheet. Forms a map of
people. Each person has a name, dayFree counter, nightFree counter, dayScheduled
counter, nightScheduled counter, maxDayHous, idealDayHours, and bestDay. The
counters are gradually updated when iterating through each person’s timeslots.
In the map, the key is the column number, which returns information about the
person in that column.

createSlots(data)
Iterates through each timeslot in the Master Schedule spreadsheet. Creates an
array of slots. Each slot has a date, time, phase, person, weight, row and col.
Updating these weights is the core idea behind the scheduling algorithm.

setAverageNightPreference(preferencesData)
Simple function to get the average worth of a night.


===============================================================================
STATUS
===============================================================================
Schedulers need a quick way to understand the results of the algorithm. The
status.gs file updates information on the Google Spreadsheet to show schedulers
everything they need.

setStatus(data)
Iterates through every row and updates the status formula. Dynamically changes
the formula if the phase is changed for any reason.


===============================================================================
ALGORITHM
===============================================================================
The scheduling algorithm is not just a simple call to one function. It
references multiple weighting functions and then some. The algorithm.gs file is
the core file for algorithm execution. (It all begins here.)

createSchedule(people,slots,data,sheet)
Iterates through every slot and updates their weights with different weighting
functions. Once all the functions have finished running, the shift with the
largest weight is scheduled and removed from the list. Once the list is empty,
the schedule is complete.

removeFilledSlots(people,slots,data,graveyard)
Some slots have no hope of being scheduled. In that case, there is no sense to
keep them in the slots array (in fact, doing so will make the algorithm run
forever). This function removes slots where enough people are already scheduled.


===============================================================================
HELPERS
===============================================================================
Simple helper.gs file that contains one helper function used in other functions

calculatePeopleNeeded(isNight, phase)
Returns the number of people needed in the tent at a given time. Defined by
line monitors.


===============================================================================
GLOBALS
===============================================================================
Gloabls.gs is a central location containing all global variables. All variables
are organized by the categories: data, data parameters, availability, phase
terms, phase requirements, month terms, time terms, and preferences.
